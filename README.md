## Introduction

This project aims to fine-tune DistilGPT-2 for the task of predicting decision makers' choices based on various types of input data. The model is evaluated on several datasets to understand the impact of different contextual information on its performance.

## Features

- Fine-tuning DistilGPT-2 for classification tasks.
- Evaluation of model performance on multiple datasets.
- Analysis of the impact of contextual data on prediction accuracy.
- Visualization of model accuracy across different experiments.
